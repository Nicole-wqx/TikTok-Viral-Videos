***Using XGBoost and Random Forest model to find the key drivers of a viral TikTok video.***

**The TikTok ecosystem is unpredictable.** While some high-quality videos receive low view counts, brief and seemingly random clips can go viral with high engagement. This project explores the **key factors that drive TikTok video virality**, focusing on facial emotion cues, transcript-based emotional tone, and creator profile metrics. 

By analyzing these variables, the study aims to uncover patterns and predictors of user engagement within the TikTokâ€™s algorithm-driven environment.
